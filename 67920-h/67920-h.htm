<h2 class="nobreak">I. Introduction.</h2>
</div>

<p>The sulphobenzoic acids have been the subject of investigation in this
laboratory for a number of years past. Among the many interesting
facts that have been brought to light in the course of this study,
perhaps no others have been attended with more interest than the
discovery of well characterized isomerism in the case of the chlorides
of orthosulphobenzoic acid, and its paranitro derivative; together
with the preparation of a series of isomeric derivatives of these
substances. The chlorides themselves have been isolated in the
crystalline condition, and have been found to differ markedly, not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in chemical, but in physical properties as well.</p>

<p>The first evidence that such isomerism existed, was obtained by Remsen
and Coates<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
 who, in the course of an investigation of the action of
aniline upon the chloride of orthosulphobenzoic acid, obtained two
isomeric anilids quite different in properties, which they designated
as fusible and infusible respectively. The following year, Remsen and
Kohler<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
obtained one of the chlorides in crystalline form, together
with an oil which they did not succeed in crystallizing.</p>

<p>This however was accomplished the succeeding year by Remsen and
Saunders<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>,
and a still more satisfactory result was obtained by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
Remsen and McKee<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
in 1895. The chloride melting at 79° was found to yield only the
fusible anilid, together with an anil, while from the lower melting
chloride, in addition to these, the infusible anilid was also formed.</p>

<p>In 1895, Gray<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
isolated the two corresponding isomeric chlorides of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, the lower melting chloride being
obtained in small quantity only. The succeeding year
Hollis<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
made a more careful study of this lower melting chloride, and prepared
it in considerable quantity.</p>

<p>From evidence drawn from the action of ammonia upon these chlorides,
taken in connection with a number of other facts, the higher melting
chloride is identified as the one possessing a symmetrical structure,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
while the lower melting chloride possesses an unsymmetrical structure.
The first one, when treated with ammonia is slowly transformed into the
ammonium salt of paranitrobenzoic sulphinide:</p>

<p>Gray’s study of the symmetrical chloride was confined for the most part
to the preparation of a series of salts of this latter acid, and to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
investigation of the action of aniline upon the chloride itself. It
was thought to be of interest to extend this study to a wider range of
reactions, as well as to improve, if possible, the method of preparing
the chloride in pure condition. At the suggestion of Prof. Remsen this
work was accordingly undertaken.</p>

The details of it are repeated here for the purpose of calling
attention to certain facts that came under the author’s notice.</p>

<p>100 grams of paranitrotoluene are added to 400 grams of fuming sulfuric
acid, and the mixture heated in a balloon flask at 100° on a water
bath. The heating is continued until a few drops of the mixture, added
to cold water, dissolves completely to a clear solution. The time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
required for this operation varies much with the conditions. Continued
stirring very considerably hastens the reaction, as paranitrotoluene
forms a layer on the acid, which presents a small surface to its
action. With constant stirring the reaction is complete in a few hours,
whereas if no stirring is resorted to, as much as several days may be
required, especially when large quantities are employed at one time.</p>

<p>When the reaction is complete, the mixture is poured into a
large volume of water, and neutralized with calcium carbonate.
In the filtrate from calcium sulphate, the calcium salt of
paranitroorthotoluene sulphonic acid is found, and this is converted
into the potassium salt in the usual way.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The oxidation of the potassium salt is effected as follows. 50 grams of
the salt are dissolved in 2½ litres of water, and to this is added a
solution of 15 grams of potassium hydroxide. The mixture is heated to
100° on a water-bath, and when this temperature is reached, 110 grams
of potassium permanganate are added. Heating is continued until the
solution is decolorized, care being taken to prevent the evolution of
free oxygen.</p>

<p>The oxides of manganese are then filtered off, the filtrate neutralized
with hydrochloric acid, and evaporated to about one fifth of its
original volume. Strong hydrochloric acid is them added in excess, and
on cooling the acid potassium salt of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid
separates in very slender colorless needles completely filling the liquid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>For the success of this operation it is important that the potassium
salt of paranitroorthotoluenesulphonic acid and the potassium hydroxide
should both be perfectly dissolved before they are heated together.
If the two substances lie together in solid form at the bottom of the
flask, a very slight elevation of temperature leads to the formation
of an extremely troublesome red substance, which is very difficult
to remove. It is almost impossible to remove it from the oxidation
product by recrystallization, since any considerable amount of it has
a marked influence on the solubility of the salt, rendering it much
more soluble. It persists throughout all subsequent transformations of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, and should therefore be carefully avoided.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Otto Fischer<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
has shown that in concentrated solution, potassium hydroxide
acts on nitro derivatives of toluene, with the formation of
various colored substances derived from stilbene. In the case of
paranitroorthotoluenesulphonic acid, he describes the substance formed
as possessing a cherry red color. The reactions involved in its
formation are:</p>

<p>It was no doubt the formation of substances of this nature that
occasioned the color observed in some of the oxidations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>The only effective method of separating this colored substance was
found to be to pass to the neutral salt of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic
acid, by making the solution slightly alkaline. The salt of this
colored substance is also formed and the two can be separated by a few
recrystallizations in a fairly satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The yield in both of the transformations involved in the preparation
of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid does not fall far short of the theoretical.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III.&emsp;Preparation of the<br />Symmetrical Chloride of<br />
Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</h2>
</div>

<p>This chloride was first separated from its unsymmetrical isomer
by Gray<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.
It was obtained by allowing a chloroform solution of
the mixed chlorides to evaporate until the chloroform had almost
entirely disappeared. In the thick liquid so obtained, crystals of the
symmetrical chloride were formed. It was also obtained by applying the
method devised by Bucher in connection with the corresponding chloride
of orthosulphobenzoic acid—i.e. by the action of dilute ammonia on the
mixed chlorides. Gray also found that the best conditions for securing
a relatively large proportion of the symmetrical chloride were, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
employment of as low a temperature as possible in the formation of the
chlorides, and of as small an excess of phosphorus pentachloride as
would suffice for the reaction.</p>

<p>After many experiments, under widely differing conditions, the
following method of procedure, embodying the results of Gray’s work,
was adopted.</p>

<p>Dehydrated acid potassium salt of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, and
phosphorus pentachloride, in the ratio of 40: 55 grams, are brought
together in a mortar and intimately mixed. The mixture is put into
an evaporating dish, and placed on a sulphuric acid bath, previously
heated to 150°. As soon as the action has been well started, the
dish is removed, and the reaction allowed to proceed without further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
heating. When it is complete, and the contents of the dish has cooled
down to the temperature of the room, the oily product is poured
slowly into a salts bottle containing ice water, the bottle being
frequently shaken during the process. The shaking is continued with
renewed portions of water, as long as the wash water is cloudy. The
water is then poured off, the brownish gummy chloride dissolved in
chloroform, and the solution placed in a good-sized separating funnel.
Ice water is then added, and the contents of the funnel treated with
successive portions of ammonia (desk ammonia diluted one half).
Shaking is continued after each addition until the odor of ammonia has
disappeared, and ice is added from time to time as may be required.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>When it is found that the odor of ammonia persists after several
minutes’ shaking, the chloroform layer, which is usually filled with a
solid substance that has separated during the process, is drawn off,
filtered, and dried with calcium chloride.</p>

<p>By this process all of the unsymmetrical chloride is converted into the
ammonium salt of paranitroorthocyanbenzenesulphonic acid, according to
the equation:</p>

<p class="no-indent">while the symmetrical chloride remains for the

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
It was found that working in this way the symmetrical chloride could
be prepared in pure condition, free from its isomer. The chloroform
completely evaporates in a short time leaving fine crystals of the
symmetrical chloride. In case the evaporation is slow and incomplete,
it may be concluded that not all of the unsymmetrical chloride has been
removed. The yield was uniformly about 40 per cent of the theoretical.</p>

<p>From the water used to wash the chlorides a considerable amount of the
original salt can be recovered, as the reaction under the conditions
employed, is never complete.</p>

<p>An examination was made of the substance mentioned as separating in
the chloroform solution of the chlorides, during the treatment with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
ammonia, and it was found to possess the following properties. It
is insoluble in benzene, chloroform, acetone, ether and ligroin;
soluble in glacial acetic acid, from which it separates on cooling
in colorless, crystalline condition; insoluble in the cold in
water, alcohol and ammonia, but by boiling with these reagents, or
by long standing in the cold, it is dissolved with decomposition.
It was dissolved in hot water and the solution, which was acid
in reaction, was neutralized with potassium carbonate. On adding
an excess of hydrochloric acid to the solution, and allowing
it to cool, characteristic crystals of acid potassium salt of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid separated. These properties identify
the substance as the anhydride of this acid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The formation of the corresponding anhydride of orthosulphobenzoic acid
by the action of phosphorus pentachloride upon its acid potassium salt
was observed by Sohon<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
who made use of the reaction to prepare this anhydride in quantity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV.&emsp;Properties of the Symmetrical Chloride<br />
                     of Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</h2>
</div>

<p>As first obtained, the crystals of the symmetrical chloride resemble
irregularly shaped pieces of amber, both in color, and in lustre.
On recrystallization from chloroform or ether, they may be obtained
perfectly colorless, and are often of very simple crystallographic
form. The chloride crystallizes in the monoclinic system, and possesses
a very remarkable crystallizing power, in which respect it differs
noticeably form its isomer. Even in chloroform solution that is far
from dry, crystals appear with the greatest ease.</p>

<p>The habit of the crystals differs very much according to the conditions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
of crystallization. Not infrequently almost perfectly formed crystals
of the simplest form—the oblique octahedron—were obtained though
for the most part the form was much more complicated, pinacoid and
dome faces, together with basal planes being prominent. As a rule, the
crystals were not suitable for crystallographic work, as the faces are
usually uneven and the edges rounded. By proper precautions however,
good ones were obtained, and measurements of these will be found in
this dissertation when it appears in print.</p>

<p>The size of some of the crystals obtained was unusual for substances
of this class. One crystal obtained with no special precautions, save
letting a solution of the chloride stand undisturbed for several days,
in a rather cool place measured 3 × 2.5 × 1.5 cm., and weighed 11.2
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
grams. The crystals are quite compact, their density being abut 1.85.
They melt at 98° (uncorr.) The chloride is quite stable in crystalline
condition. Even in moist air the crystals were unchanged, and retained
their lustre as long as they were in my possession.</p>

<p>An analysis for chlorine gave the following results.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V.&emsp;The Action of Benzene and Aluminium Chloride<br />
                    on the Symmetrical Chloride of<br />
                    Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</h2>
</div>

<p>Hollis<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
in his study of the action of these reagents upon the
unsymmetrical chloride, tested their action upon one portion of the
symmetrical chloride, and found the products to be identical in the two
cases. A few experiments were made in confirmation of these results,
and the same products, in general, were obtained. It was observed
however that the reactions differ in the relative ease with which
they are brought about. In the case of the symmetrical chloride, the
reaction is a much more vigorous one. On adding aluminium chloride to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
a solution of the symmetrical chloride, in benzene, action begins at
once the temperature of the hand, and very little external heat, and
that only in the latter stages of the operation, is needful for the
completion of the reaction. The application of much heat converts
all of the product into thick tarry substances from which nothing
satisfactory could be obtained.</p>

<p>When the reaction was complete, the resulting product was isolated and
purified in accordance with the directions given by Hollis. Repeated
trials showed that, as in the case of the unsymmetrical chloride, only
one phenyl group could be introduced by this method. The resulting
compound, paranitroorthobenzoylbenzenesulphon chloride, was identical
with that derived from the unsymmetrical chloride. Owing, however, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the fact that so much more decomposition occurs in the reaction with
the symmetrical chloride, in paranitroorthobenzoylbenzene sulphon
chloride could not be obtained in perfectly pure condition. In
appearance it agreed closely with that described by Hollis, forming
very characteristic greenish, rhombic crystals. These melted, not very
sharply, at 174° instead of 177° as observed by Hollis.</p>

<p>Accordingly, to establish the identity of the two compounds beyond
any doubt, the material on hand was converted into the barium salt of
paranitroorthobenzoylbenzene sulphonic acid. This was done by boiling
the sulphon chloride with dilute hydrochloric acid until complete
solution had been effected; evaporating to dryness on a water-bath;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
dissolving the residue in hot water, and neutralizing with barium
carbonate. On filtering the hot solution from the excess of carbonate,
and allowing it to cool, the barium salt separated.</p>

<p>The solution was somewhat colored by impurities, and the long needles
in which the salt crystallized were also somewhat colored. They were
analysed with the expectation that they would prove to be specimens
of the salt described by Hollis as having three, or three and a half
molecules of water of crystallization, in as much as the conditions
under which they were formed were favorable to the formation of salts
with these ratios of water of crystallization. Hollis found that this
salt could be obtained with at least four different ratios of water of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
crystallization viz. three, three and a half, six and seven molecules
respectively. The analysis was as follows, the amount of barium being
calculated on the basis of the anhydrous salt.</p>

<p>In making a further supply of the salt it was found that if the
solution, after filtering from the barium carbonate, was diluted to
such an extent that no crystals separated on cooling, then on slow
evaporation under a bell-jar the first crystals to appear were very
long slender needles. As evaporation proceeded, these needles became
much thicker assuming prismatic proportions, and corresponded in
appearance to the salt described by Hollis as having six molecules of
crystal water.</p>

<p>As growth proceeded, the crystals became dark in color, and the
mother-liquor correspondingly clearer, the crystals evidently absorbing
the impurity in their growth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>When the solution had become quite colorless, rhombic crystals of the
salt containing seven molecules of water of crystallization appeared.
The larger prismatic crystals were carefully removed, and redissolved
in water in order to see if the same phenomena would repeat themselves.
This in fact was the case, crystals of both types appearing in the
same way as described. Without separating the crystals in this second
experiment, water was added, and the crystals dissolved. The solution
was then warmed briskly with boneblack, and filtered. From the filtrate,
which was colorless, nothing but rhombic crystals having seven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
molecules of water of crystallization could be obtained, although a
great many variations in the conditions were tried. Analysis of these
last crystals was as follows:</p>

<p>Hollis states that treatment with boneblack decomposes this salt,
and hence he did not purify it prior to crystallization. From the
experiments just described it seems probable that the impurities
present affect the crystalline habit, and the degree of hydration of
this salt in a very striking manner. By careful warming with boneblack
no decomposition was observed, and the crystals so obtained have
constantly seven molecules of crystal water.</p>

solution boiled until a drop added to cold water gave no precipitate,
of unchanged chloride. The alcohol was then distilled off, and
the thick syrup remaining, diluted with water. This solution was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
neutralized with barium carbonate and filtered. On cooling, the barium
salt crystallized in shining mica-like plates, or in yellowish needles
corresponding accurately with those described by Kastle. They gave the
following analytical results.</p>

<p>Kastle also found that by dissolving the mixed chlorides in alcohol in
the cold, and allowing the solution to evaporate, there separated after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
a time, crystals of the chloride of the acid etherial salt of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid whose formation and composition are
represented in equation I.</p>

<p>This same product was sought for when pure symmetrical chloride was
employed, but without success. In every case, crystals of unchanged
chloride separated, or else it was found that it had been completely
converted into the acid etherial salt. In another trial cold water
was carefully added in small portions, since Kastle found that such
treatment facilitated the separation of the substance; the chloride
alone appeared. Still other attempts were made to obtain the substance
by adding a large amount of water to the solution of the chloride in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
alcohol, after it had stood for some time. In this way, quite a
precipitate was thrown down, and this was filtered off and crystallized
from ether. It always proved to be the symmetrical chloride, and none
of the other substance was obtained.</p>

<p>Karslake<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
in working with the symmetrical chloride of
orthosulphobenzoic acid, was unable to isolate the analogous compound,
although from the mixed chlorides, by the action of alcohols, Remsen
and Dohme<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
had obtained chloro-etherial salts.</p>

<p>In as much as the pure symmetrical chloride is relatively stable in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
cold alcohol (it can be crystallized from warm alcohol with very
little loss), it is possible that it is more stable than the chloro
etherial salt, and that in consequence the latter, when formed, yields
more readily to the further action of alcohol than does the unacted
on chloride. Hence when the action begins, it at once proceeds to the
limit. The fact that the symmetrical chloride is rather sparingly
soluble in cold alcohol, making the use of concentrated solutions
impossible, may also be a factor in the case. Whatever may be the
cause, this substance could not be obtained under any conditions that
were devised.</p>

<p id="VI_3">Having in my possession a very small specimen of crystallized
unsymmetrical chloride, it was submitted to the action of ethyl
alcohol, under as nearly as possible the conditions employed by Kastle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Crystals of a colorless substance were obtained, which in every respect
agreed with Kastle’s description of the chloride of the acid ethyl
etherial salt of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid. Crystallized from
ether they melted at 68°.</p>

<p>The conditions employed by Kastle in preparing the chloride would
undoubtedly lead to a relatively large proportion of unsymmetrical
chloride, and it is to this chloride that the formation of the chloro
etherial salt is apparently due.</p>

</div>

<p>Remsen and Saunders<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
in their investigation of the chlorides of
orthosulphobenzoic acid, studied the action of phenol upon these
substances, and from both the symmetrical chloride and the mixed
chlorides, they obtained a normal diphenyl ether together with a
red substance which was not further studied. It was formed in small
quantity and was probably the corresponding sulphonphthalein. Later
McKee<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
obtained these same substances from both the symmetrical
and the unsymmetrical chlorides. R. Meyer<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
obtained analogous substances by the action of various phenols upon phthalyl chloride.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
It seemed probable, therefore, that the chlorides of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid would yield similar derivatives,
and a study was accordingly made of the reaction of the symmetrical
chloride with a series of phenols. The products in some instances were
exceedingly difficult to deal with, possessing properties that made it
impossible to prepare them for analysis, but even in such cases there could
be little doubt as to the general nature of the reactions which had occurred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p id="VII_1"><span class="fontsize_120 space-above1"><b>1.</b></span>The Action of
Phenol upon the Symmetrical Chloride of Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</p>

<p>A portion of the symmetrical chloride was brought together with
somewhat more than double the molecular amount of phenol. The mixture
was placed in a good-sized test-tube and the temperature gradually
raised by means of a sulphuric acid bath.</p>

<p>As soon as the phenol melts, some slight action occurs, as is indicated
by the fact that the mixture assumes a bright red color. No appreciable
amount of hydrochloric acid gas is evolved however, until the liquid
mixture has reached a temperature of about 115°. At this point the gas
is freely evolved, and the action is complete at a temperature of 125°.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
The temperature observations were made by means of a thermometer used
as a stirring rod in the mixture. During the heating, the color of the
liquid becomes a much more intense red, growing darker in shade, and the
liquid itself becomes somewhat viscous but does not solidify while hot.</p>

<p>When cool, the melt was repeatedly extracted with boiling water,
the aqueous solution being very deep purple in color. The colored
matter was removed very slowly in this manner, and so the process
was continued with dilute alkali. A solid insoluble residue was thus
obtained, of a light-brownish color. This was dissolved in alcohol,
boiled with boneblack and filtered. On cooling, needles of a straw
yellow color were deposited from the alcoholic solution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>This proved to be the normal diphenyl etherial salt of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, the formation of this substance being

McKee<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>

<p>On evaporating the aqueous extract from the original melt almost to
dryness on the water-bath, there was a deposit on the sides of thedish
of scales possessing a beautiful bronze-green metallic lustre They
formed a deep purple solution in alkalis, or magenta, if the solution
was very dilute, and orange-yellow in acids. On acidifying the alkaline
extract with hydrochloric acid, this same substance was precipitated as
a brownish flocculent precipitate. It was, however, found to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
impossible to obtain this substance in pure condition. The amount
formed in the reaction is small, and its properties were such as to
render work with it very difficult. The method of precipitation is not
satisfactory because, owing to the fact that the substance is soluble
in acid solutions to an unusual extent for substances of this class,
the solution had to be concentrated to such a degree as to render the
precipitated substance very impure from acids and alkali salts. These
could not be removed by washing, obviously, without again dissolving
the substance. From its properties however, and its color reactions,
there can be little doubt that the substance is a sulphonphthaleïn, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
that it is always formed in considerable quantities in the reaction of
phenol upon the symmetrical chloride.</p>

<p>It was noticed that the aqueous extract of the mass left after fusion
was almost always decidedly acid in reaction, and it was thought that
this might be due to the formation of an acid etherial salt, whose

The Action of Orthocresol upon the Symmetrical Chloride of
Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</p>

<p>With orthocresol the reaction proceeds with more difficulty. A higher
temperature was required (135°-145°), and quite an amount of tarry
material was obtained from which very little could be extracted. The
product was warmed repeatedly with dilute alkali, the solution so
obtained neutralized with hydrochloric acid, and distilled with steam
for several hours to free it from cresol. The resulting solution was
then evaporated to small volume, and acidified with hydrochloric acid.
A considerable precipitate was thrown down, which was easily filtered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
off and dried. In this condition it is a dark purple-red powder, lumps
of which possessed a yellowish-bronze metallic lustre. In dilute
alkaline solution it forms a deep-bluish purple solution, while in
acids it is crimson, or light yellow if the solution is dilute. It is a
excellent indicator, especially with ammonia.</p>

<p>In the insoluble tarry substance the etherial salt was sought for
and obtained in small quantity only. As this substance is soluble in
alcohol, and separates again on cooling in much the same condition,
the etherial salt could not be isolated be crystallization from this
solvent. By boiling the substance with benzene, purifying the filtrate
with boneblack, and allowing the benzene to evaporate, an almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
colorless gummy substance was obtained, which when dissolved in
alcohol, crystallizes in small colorless needles which melt at 89°-90°.
They were not obtained in quantity sufficient for analysis, but there
was little doubt that they were crystals of the diorthocresol etherial salt.</p>

<p>Apparently much more decomposition occurred in this reaction than
when paracresol was employed, probably in consequence of the higher
temperature required for the reaction.

<p>This reaction was conducted in the same manner as with phenol. No
hydrochloric acid was evolved until a temperature of about 110° was
reached, although after melting, the solution had steadily darkened to
a deep reddish-brown color. At 130°, after heating for several hours,
hydrochloric acid ceased to be evolved. The product was treated as in
the last experiment. The alkaline extract did not exhibit any marked
color reactions, such as were observed in most of these experiments,
being dull reddish-brown in both acid and alkaline solution.

transparent crystals, which did not lose their color by repeated

through loss of benzene of crystallization.</p>

The Action of Hydroquinone upon the Symmetrical Chloride of

<p>Action with hydroquinone occurs at 120°-135°, the mixture at the same
time becoming dark colored and viscous.</p>

<p>On cooling, the product was powdered and treated with dilute alkali.
It readily dissolved, without residue, forming a dark red solution.
In concentrated solution the addition of acid produces a voluminous

<p>The reaction of resorcin with the chloride is a much cleaner one

apparently to an individual compound which is well characterized.</p>

<p>During the reaction, which is complete at 125°, the mixture becomes
almost perfectly solid, and when cool, it is quite brittle. It was
reduced to a reddish powder in a mortar and dissolved in sodium

light chocolate-brown powder. In dilute alkaline solution it possesses
a slight fluorescence being pink by transmitted and yellow be reflected
light, suggesting eosin in a general way. It is interesting to note
that the sulphonfluoresceïn of orthosulphobenzoic acid possesses a
fluorescence that can hardly be distinguished from ordinary fluoresceïn
and that the introduction of a nitro group into the acid residue
produces much of the same effect as do the four bromine atoms in eosin.

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII.&emsp;The Action of Aniline upon<br /> the Symmetrical
Chloride<br /> of Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</h2>
</div>

<p>As has been pointed out in the Introduction, it was in connection
with the aniline derivatives of orthosulphobenzoic acid, that the
isomerism of the chlorides was first noticed, two anilids being
obtained. Accordingly, when Gray began his study of the chlorides
of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, his first effort was to obtain
evidence of the existence of two anilids. These were not obtained,
however, until after the chlorides themselves had been isolated, as their
properties made their isolation and preparation a matter of difficulty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Some points still remained in doubt after Gray’s study, and a further
investigation was thought to be desirable to clear these up.</p>

<p>Some time was spent in an endeavor to obtain a method by which a good
yield of fusible, or symmetrical, anilid could be obtained. The yield
in all cases tried, is not a good one. The presence of the nitro group
appears to complicate the reaction, leading to secondary reactions
whose course could not be followed. Upon bringing aniline and the
chloride together, a very vivid red color was always observed, and the
same was true when it was necessary to employ alkali. The fact that
such colors develop when nitro compounds are treated with alkali has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
been noticed in many instances and some progress has been made in the
study of these compounds. Jackson and Ittner<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
have lately reviewed this subject.</p>

<p>If a solution of the symmetrical chloride in ether is slowly added to a
similar solution of aniline, no appreciable amount of heat is evolved.
If the resulting solution is allowed to stand at ordinary temperatures,
action proceeds very slowly, aniline hydrochloride being precipitated
as the reaction proceeds. This can be filtered off from time to time
and the rate of action so observed. In such a way it was found that
five grams of chloride required about fifty hours time to react
completely with an excess of aniline. Similar results were obtained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
with chloroform as the solvent. By boiling the solution for an hour or
more the reaction is complete.</p>

<p>The method employed was to bring the chloride and an excess of
aniline—somewhat more than four molecules—together in chloroform
solution. The flask was then boiled for about an hour, when the
chloroform was distilled off. During the boiling as well as the
distillation more or less bumping occurs in consequence of the aniline
hydrochloride which separates, and constant shaking of the flask is
sometimes necessary. The residue which is in a thick, gummy condition
in consequence of the presence of an excess of aniline, was digested
with water acidulated with hydrochloric acid. The excess of aniline is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
thus removed, and the reaction product obtained as a reddish-brown
solid substance. This was treated with dilute sodium hydroxide, all
lumps being broken up with a stirring rod. The undissolved substance
is largely anil, which was filtered off. The anilid was then regained
by acidifying the alkaline solution, in which it was dissolved. It
separates immediately as a curdy colorless precipitate, though it is
frequently colored pink by impurity. It was found that this color could
be removed, in case not much was present, by redissolving the anilid in
alkali, and slowly pouring the solution into an excess of dilute acid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>In all cases a considerable amount of anil was obtained, even when the
substances were employed in the molecular ratios of 1:10. The reactions
involved, so far as the formation of anilid and anil are concerned are,</p>

<p>On the whole the reaction seemed to be the most satisfactory in
chloroform solution, the main objection being, that, owing to the
simultaneous presence of chloroform, alkali, an a trace of aniline,
phenyl isocyanide is always formed, and renders the work more or less
unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>The method employed in this study was as follows. A tubulated retort
of convenient size was fused onto the inner tube of a small condenser.
This was done to avoid connections, which are nearly always attacked by
the oxychloride. Another satisfactory plan is to have the neck of the
retort of the same size as the inner tube of the condenser. The ends
are placed in contact, and the tubes bound in position by wrapping with
asbestos paper. Over the joint so made, a tight rubber tube is drawn.</p>

<p>A convenient amount of phosphorus oxychloride (50 c.c.) was placed in
the retort and the anilid (5 gr.) added through the tubulus. On boiling,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
with the condenser inverted, the anilid soon dissolved, with evolution
of hydrochloric acid gas, and the solution became bright yellow in
color, sometimes inclining to orange. The boiling was continued as long
as hydrochloric acid was given off. The oxychloride was then distilled
off under diminished pressure, care being taken to shake the retort
constantly during the distillation as violent bumping is almost sure
to occur especially towards the end of the operation. The product
remaining, spattered over the walls of the retort, was a greenish
yellow solid.</p>

<p>Water was then added, and the whole allowed to stand for an hour or so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
to thoroughly dissolve the phosphoric acid formed in the reaction.</p>

<p>In case the anilid is not perfectly dry, a much more energetic reaction
occurs, and on distilling off the oxychloride, the product remains as a
dark, gummy mass. This should be spread out on the sides of the retort
while still liquid. On cooling and adding water, this gum gradually
disappears, and in its place is found the yellow solid product just
described. The gum appears to be a solution of this substance in
phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>After the substance is filtered off and dried, it can be crystallized
from acetone, benzene, glacial acetic acid or alcohol. From these solvents
it crystallizes in small yellow needles resembling quinone in appearance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The crystals obtained form acetone are rather larger than those from
the other solvents, and are more nearly orange in color, apparently
because of their greater compactness. When glacial acetic acid is used,
care must be taken to avoid any unnecessary heating, as continued
heating produces a change that will presently be described. The
substance melts at 208°.</p>

&nbsp;of Paranitroorthosulphobenzoic Acid.</h2>
</div>

<p id="X_1"><span class="fontsize_120 space-above1"><b>1.</b></span>
The Action of Hydrochloric Acid on the Dianil</p>

<p>When the dianil is boiled for some time with concentrated hydrochloric
acid, the yellow color of the substance disappears, and the dianil is
converted into a colorless substance without, however, passing into
solution. The substance so obtained was filtered off, and crystallized
from alcohol. It crystallized in small colorless needles, which melted
at 183°, and possessed all the properties of the anil, which, in fact,
it proved to be. The reaction was therefore</p>

<span class="ws4">NO₂</span><span class="ws11">NO₂</span><br />
</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
This reaction also explains the fact that some anil was always obtained
in making the dianil from the anilid. Hydrochloric acid is formed
in the reaction, and in turn acts on the dianil in the sense of the
equation just given.</p>

<p id="X_2"><span class="fontsize_120 space-above1"><b>2.</b></span>
The Action of Alcoholic Potash on the Dianil.</p>

<p>On boiling the dianil with alcoholic potash for a time, the solution
turned red, and nothing but tarry products were obtained. In this
respect the dianil differs from the dianil of orthosulphobenzoic acid,
which under similar conditions, is transformed into infusible anilid.
This observation is, however, in keeping with the fact that the nitro
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
derivative, is in general much less stable in the presence of alkali.</p>

<p id="X_3"><span class="fontsize_120 space-above1"><b>3.</b></span>
The Action of Glacial Acetic Acid on the Dianil.</p>

<p>When the dianil is boiled with glacial acetic acid for some time, the
color of the solution changes to a much lighter shade of yellow, or
becomes colorless. On evaporating the solution to small volume, and
allowing it to cool, a colorless substance separates. This is infusible
anilid. It could not be obtained in crystals from any solvent, but
always separated in flakes. It does not melt or undergo change at 340°.</p>

<p>Like the fusible anilid it dissolves in dilute alkali, but on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
acidifying the solution it does not immediately reappear. After
standing for some time, however, it gradually separates in perfectly
pure form. In this particular my observation differs from that of
Gray,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
who states that this anilid is decomposed by solution in alkali.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Conclusions.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the course of this investigation several facts have been established.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. By the methods described, the symmetrical chloride of
paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid can be obtained in fine crystalline
form, perfectly free from its isomer, with an average yield of forty
percent.</p>

<p>2. By treatment of the chloride with benzene and aluminium chloride,
only one chlorine atom can be replaced by a phenyl group.</p>

<p>3. The barium salt of paranitroorthobenzoyl benzenesulphonic acid, when
perfectly pure, crystallizes constantly with seven molecules of water
of crystallization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>4. With alcohols, the symmetrical chloride yields directly the acid
etherial salt of paranitroorthosulphobenzoic acid, no evidence
having been obtained of an intermediate chloro-etherial salt. The
unsymmetrical chloride on the other hand yields the intermediate
product.</p>

<p>5. With phenols, two series of derivatives are obtained.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="neg-indent">(1) With monohydroxy phenols, both etherial salts and
sulphonphthaleïns are formed, the former predominating.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(2) With polyhydroxy phenols no etherial salts were obtained,
but compounds of the unsymmetrical type, usually containing
more than two phenol residues.</p>
</div>

<p>6. With aniline an anil and an anilid of symmetrical constitution are
formed.</p>

<p>7. With phosphorus oxychloride, the anilid, by loss of water, forms a dianil.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>8. This dianil undergoes transformation with</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="neg-indent">(1) Glacial acetic acid, forming an anilid of unsymmetrical constitution.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(2) Hydrochloric acid forming the anil.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">(3) Alcoholic potash, with the formation of colored decomposition products.</p>

<p>The author of the foregoing dissertation was born at Wilkinsburg, Pa.,
Jan. 29., 1870. Owing to prolonged sickness in childhood his education,
prior to entering college, was much interrupted, and was largely
confined to instruction received at home.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1887 he entered Wooster University (Ohio), from which
institution he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1891. The two
following years were spent as a teacher of Sciences in the College of
Emporia (Kansas). In 1893 he entered the Johns Hopkins University where
he has since been a student of chemistry, with physics and mathematics
as subordinate studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
In 1895 he was appointed University Scholar in Chemistry. During 1895-6
he served as lecture assistant to Prof. Remsen and Dr. Renouf in the
undergraduate courses. In the spring of 1896 he was appointed Fellow
for the present year.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
